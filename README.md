<h3>About Project :</h3>
The idea behind the project is to allow for user to buy a bus ticket more conviniently.
This is by looking at diffarent situation in life like: 
* Buying a ticket for a kid or that girl that yur not sure she will actually come over.
* You can wallet someone money that they can only use for transport.
* Make it easier for conductors to be able to make sure that everyones payed before time.
* Makes it easier to track income from the vehicles.
* Makes it harder to overload
* Less noise as matatus dont have to hoot to know if some one needs a car

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
